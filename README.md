=======

Learn math concepts and operations visually.


Motivation
----------

Much of our early math learning involves memorization; while a kindergartner
can easily enough do addition and subtraction by counting on their fingers,
it's cumbersome until the single-digit sums are memorized. Efficient
multiplication involves memorizing a sizable grid of products which are tedious
to calculate by counting on one's fingers, and difficult to grasp without a
good visual aid.

Physical visual aids, such as adding two piles of pennies, or counting the
studs on an M x N Lego brick, can help with internalizing what's going on when
we do symbolic math with numerals and operators, but it is time-consuming to do
it this way. Computers can show such visualizations immediately, along with
their symbolic representation, giving the child an immediate connection between
"7 * 5 = 35" and the actual quantity that represents.


Goals
-----

Matheye in a way aims to present interactive cheat-sheets of basic mathematics.
It doesn't prompt the user for correct answers; what it does is show all of the
answers, along with a graphical demonstration of why that answer is correct. It
is a sort of numeric playground, a field of numbers to explore.
